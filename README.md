# Ridge Regression from Scratch

This project implements a ridge regression analysis pipeline called `LinRegAPI` from scratch in Python using only the `Pandas`, `numpy`, and `MatplotLib` packages. The `LinRegAPI` allows for data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, leave-k-out crossvalidation, hyperparameter tuning, and postprocessing. 
The pipeline is used to develop a model for a healthcare costing dataset as a case study.
