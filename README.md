# Ridge Regression from Scratch

This project implements a ridge regression analysis pipeline called `LinRegAPI` from scratch in Python using only the `Pandas`, `numpy`, and `MatplotLib` packages. The `LinRegAPI` allows for data ingestion, cleaning, modeling, hyperparameter tuning using crossvalidation, and postprocessing. 
The pipeline is used to develop a model for a healthcare costing dataset as a case study.
